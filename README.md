1. download the glove files from the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WlFR4Du-rY_SRA75pB3Hxp2tPZfG0hLx?usp=sharing
2. place them in the "resources" folder.
3. these are 50 and 200 dimensional word embeddings. you can choose to work with either of them.
4. the reqirements.txt file has all the necessary modules that need installing. run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to instal them.
5. the main driver file is the "main.py". customize/play around with the global variables.
6. BEFORE RUNNING THE CODE, run the commented lines 54 and 55 in main.py to generate the jsonl.gz files. This is a one time thing.
7. the comments are self explanatory. they're a good source to understand the code.
